# Python Basics

Welcome to the Python basics guide! This document covers fundamental Python concepts such as comments, variables, data types, and strings.

## Comments in Python
Comments in Python are used to make the code more readable and to provide explanations or annotations about the logic or purpose of the code. They are ignored by the Python interpreter during execution.

### Types of Comments:
1. **Single-line Comments**:
   - Start with the `#` symbol.
   ```python
   # This is a single-line comment
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```

2. **Multi-line Comments**:
   - Python does not have a specific syntax for multi-line comments, but triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) are often used as a workaround.
   ```python
   """
   This is a multi-line comment.
   It can span multiple lines.
   """
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```

### Best Practices:
- Use comments to explain *why* something is done, not *what* is done.
- Keep comments concise and relevant.
- Avoid over-commenting trivial code.

## Python Variables
A variable in Python is a container used to store data values. It acts as a label that points to the memory location where the data is stored.

### Key Features of Python Variables:
1. **Dynamic Typing**:  
   - Variables do not require explicit declaration of their type.
   ```python
   x = 10       # Integer
   y = "Hello"  # String
   z = 3.14     # Float
   ```

2. **Variable Naming Rules**:
   - Must start with a letter or an underscore (`_`).
   - Can contain letters, digits, and underscores.
   - Cannot use reserved keywords.
   - Case-sensitive (`name` and `Name` are different).
   - Examples of **valid names**: `myVar`, `_myVar`, `var_2`
   - Examples of **invalid names**: `2myVar`, `my-var`, `my var`
   - Naming conventions:
     - **Camel Case**: `myVariableName`
     - **Pascal Case**: `MyVariableName`
     - **Snake Case**: `my_variable_name`

3. **Assigning Values**:
   ```python
   age = 25
   name = "Alice"
   ```

4. **Multiple Assignments**:
   ```python
   a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
   ```

5. **Reassignment**:
   ```python
   x = 5       # Integer
   x = "Five"  # String
   ```

## Python Built-in Data Types
Python provides various built-in data types categorized as follows:

### Data Type Categories:
1. **Text Type**: `str` (e.g., `"Hello"`)
2. **Numeric Types**: `int`, `float`, `complex` (e.g., `20`, `20.5`, `1j`)
3. **Sequence Types**: `list`, `tuple`, `range`
4. **Mapping Type**: `dict`
5. **Set Types**: `set`, `frozenset`
6. **Boolean Type**: `bool`
7. **Binary Types**: `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`
8. **None Type**: `NoneType`

### Examples:
```python
# Text Type
x = str("Hello World")
print(x, type(x))  # Output: Hello World <class 'str'>

# Numeric Types
x = int(20)
print(x, type(x))  # Output: 20 <class 'int'>

x = float(20.5)
print(x, type(x))  # Output: 20.5 <class 'float'>

x = complex(1j)
print(x, type(x))  # Output: 1j <class 'complex'>
```

## Python Strings - Short Notes

### Definition
Strings in Python are sequences of characters enclosed in single `'`, double `"`, or triple quotes `'''`/`"""`.  
Example:
```python
x = "Hello"
y = 'World'
z = """Python is great"""
```

### Key Features:
- **Immutable**: Strings cannot be changed after creation.
- **Indexing**: Characters are accessed using positive or negative indexes.
  
Example:
```python
s = "Python"
print(s[0])   # P
print(s[-1])  # n
```

### String Operations:
1. **Concatenation**: Combine strings using `+`.
   ```python
   "Hello" + " World"  # Hello World
   ```

2. **Repetition**: Repeat strings using `*`.
   ```python
   "Hi!" * 3  # Hi!Hi!Hi!
   ```

3. **Slicing**: Extract substrings using `[start:end]`.
   ```python
   s = "Hello, World!"
   print(s[2:5])  # llo
   ```

### String Methods:
- **`upper()`**: Converts to uppercase.
  ```python
  "hello".upper()  # HELLO
  ```

- **`lower()`**: Converts to lowercase.
  ```python
  "HELLO".lower()  # hello
  ```

- **`strip()`**: Removes leading/trailing whitespace.
  ```python
  " Hello ".strip()  # Hello
  ```

- **`replace()`**: Replaces a substring.
  ```python
  "Hello".replace("H", "J")  # Jello
  ```

- **`split()`**: Splits into a list.
  ```python
  "a,b,c".split(",")  # ['a', 'b', 'c']
  ```

### String Formatting:
1. **f-Strings**:
   ```python
   name = "John"
   age = 30
   print(f"My name is {name}, and I am {age}")  # My name is John, and I am 30
   ```

2. **`format()`**:
   ```python
   price = 50
   print("Price is {}".format(price))  # Price is 50
   ```
