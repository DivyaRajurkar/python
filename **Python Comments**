**Python Comments**  

Comments in Python are used to make the code more readable and to provide explanations or annotations about the logic or purpose of the code. They are ignored by the Python interpreter during execution.  

### Types of Comments:  
1. **Single-line Comments**:  
   - Start with the `#` symbol.  
   - Example:  
     ```python
     # This is a single-line comment
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```

2. **Multi-line Comments**:  
   - Python does not have a specific syntax for multi-line comments, but triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) are often used as a workaround.  
   - Example:  
     ```python
     """
     This is a multi-line comment.
     It can span multiple lines.
     """
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```

### Best Practices:
- Use comments to explain *why* something is done, not *what* is done (the code itself shows what is done).  
- Keep comments concise and relevant.  
- Avoid over-commenting trivial code.  

Well-commented code improves maintainability and helps others (and your future self) understand the program.
