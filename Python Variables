**Python Variables**  

A variable in Python is a container used to store data values. It acts as a label that points to the memory location where the data is stored. Variables can hold different types of data such as numbers, strings, lists, or more complex structures.

### Key Features of Python Variables:
1. **Dynamic Typing**:  
   - Variables do not require explicit declaration of their type. The type is determined based on the assigned value.  
   - Example:  
     ```python
     x = 10       # Integer
     y = "Hello"  # String
     z = 3.14     # Float
     ```

2. **Variable Naming Rules**:
   - Must start with a letter or an underscore (`_`).
   - Can contain letters, digits, and underscores.
   - Cannot use reserved keywords (e.g., `if`, `for`, `class`).
   - Case-sensitive (`name` and `Name` are different).

3. **Assigning Values**:
   - Assignment is done using the `=` operator.
   - Example:  
     ```python
     age = 25
     name = "Alice"
     ```

4. **Multiple Assignments**:
   - Assign multiple variables in a single line.  
     ```python
     a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
     ```

5. **Reassignment**:
   - Variables can be reassigned to new values or even different data types.  
     ```python
     x = 5       # Integer
     x = "Five"  # String
     ```

Python's simplicity and flexibility with variables make it a powerful language for developers.
